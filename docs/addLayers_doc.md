## Add display elements (OPTIONAL)

This section allows users to add a maximum of three layers to the map for visualization purposes only. Additional layers can be 
uploaded as Shapefiles or as layers from a GeoPackage. These can be vector data (points, lines, or polygons) but 
cannot be rasters. Layers will appear on the map using their original names, and colors are assigned as indicated in the side panel. They aren't considered in the analysis.
