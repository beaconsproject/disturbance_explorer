## Add display elements (OPTIONAL)

This section allows users to add a maximum of three vector layers and two raster layers to the map for visualization purposes only. Additional vector layers can be 
uploaded either as Shapefiles or as layers from a GeoPackage. These layers may consist of points, lines, or polygons. On the map, layers are displayed using their original names, with colors assigned according to the side panel. Note that these layers are for visualization only and are not included in the analysis.
