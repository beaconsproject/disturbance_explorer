## Datasets
  
This page outlines the required and optional spatial layers used by **Disturbance Explorer**. The required layers are uploaded via a single GeoPackage. For the app to recognize the spatial layers in the GeoPackage, the layer names **must exactly match the expected names shown below.** All spatial layers must have the same projection.
  
### Map layers

#### Required - GeoPackage

- **studyarea**: A polygon of the study area e.g., watershed, ecoregion or any other user-defined area.
- **linear_disturbance and/or areal_disturbance** 
  - **linear_disturbance**: Linear human surface disturbance features e.g., roads, seismic line. 
  - **areal_disturbance**: Areal (polygonal) human surface disturbance features e.g., mine, town site, cutblock. 

#### Optional - GeoPackage 

Bold text is the required name of the spatial layer in the GeoPackage.

- **fires** : Distribution of wildfire polygons. The layer must have the following two attributes: (1) "YEAR" - an integer  which is the ignition year of the fire e.g., 1995 and (2) "CAUSE" - cause of ignition of the fire which can either be 'Human', 'Lightning' or 'Unknown'.  
- **protected_areas**: Distribution of protected areas e.g., Canadian Protected and Conserved Areas Database. 
- **Quartz_Claims**: Quartz mining claims for hard rock mining. 
- **Placer_Claims**: Placer mining claims for the mining of waterways (e.g., stream beds, wetlands) for mineral deposits (e.g., gold).
- **Mining_Claims**: Generic option for mining claims.
- **Intact_FL_2000**: Distribution of intact forest landscapes in the year 2000 (Potapov et al. 2017).
- **Intact_FL_2020**: Distribution of intact forest landscapes in the year 2020 (Potapov et al. 2017).

#### Optional - Shapefile

There are no requirements for the shapefile name.

- **Other disturbances** (linear and areal) can be uploaded as shapefiles and included in the analysis. However, only an overall buffer size can be applied to additional disturbances.

ðŸ“Œ Note: All layers in the GeoPackage and the shapefiles for **Other disturbances** must have the same projection. Additionally, the study area must contain the full extent of disturbance layers for
accurate analysis.
