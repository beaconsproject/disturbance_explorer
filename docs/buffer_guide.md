## Buffer features

In this step, the user specifies the disturbance layers and associated buffers for creating the undisturbed and disturbed areas maps. The disturbance layer options include linear and areal anthropogenic disturbances, other disturbances, mining claims, and fire, assuming the spatial layers have been uploaded in the previous step.

**Select buffer type:** The user has two options.

  1. **Use custom buffers** - Select this option if variable buffer widths are desired e.g., 1000-m buffer for highways and 500-m buffer for trails. If selected, the **mapview** will be replaced with the table summarizing linear and area disturbances under the **custom buffers** tab. Variable buffer widths are assigned via the table by editing the widths in the column named "BUFFER_SIZE_M". The default buffer width assigned to all disturbances is 500 m.



Users have two options:

  - Apply an overall buffer on the respective layers using sliders, or 
  - Enable custom buffer sizes based on industry and feature types. 
  
Choosing **Use custom buffers** will switch the map view to display the table where disturbances have been summarized by industry/feature types. Value inside the 'BUFFER_SIZE' column can be edited.

In the left sidebar, minimum patch size of intactness areas can be set using the slider after the buffering on the disturbance features are applied. 
This function will remove every patch in the study area that are considered not sufficiently large to maintain key ecological processes.

The user can choose to include other disturbances, fires and mining claims if these layers are present in the GeoPackage for generating undisturbed and disturbed maps.
Default values are provided for the buffer size around other disturbances, the minimum fire size, and the buffer size around mining claims, 
but these can be adjusted before generating the maps.

If other disturbances, fires and mining claims are not present in the provided GeoPackage, the corresponding options will be disabled.

#### Generate undisturbed  and disturbed areas

Click on **Generate undisturbed areas** to trigger the generation of undisturbed and disturbed maps. After a few seconds to a minute, two new layers will appear in the 
map and legend: a "disturbed" layer that shows the human/fires influence on the landscape and an "undisturbed" layer which shows all regions within the study region that 
are not intersected by the disturbed areas. These areas are presumed to retain natural ecological conditions.

#### View statistics

The "Statistics" tab on the right panel provides regional summaries of the landscape provided. 
If Intact Forest Landscapes (IFL) for the years 2000 and 2020 are available, users can compare their generated undisturbed areas to these reference datasets.
The table also displays the statistics on fires, mining and protected areas if provided.
