# User guide

The purpose of the Regional Disturbance Explorer app is to enable users to interactively create a landscape intactness map or, conversely, a human footprint map. 
The app also allows users to assess the influence of buffer size and minimum patch size on the resulting intactness and footprint maps. This page describes the main functions.
The worflow diagram below provides an overview of the process.

## Welcome

The **Overview** section is the landing page. It briefly provides a description of the app, its functionality, and the demo datasets. 
It also provide access to the user guide and the datasets sections. The Datasets section provides the description of the required and optional map layers that are used by the Disturbance Explorer apps. 
The user can start the app by selecting 'Select study area' on the leftside panel.

## Select study area

Click on **Select study area** to begin. You have two options:

  - Use demo dataset (which is embedded in the app). This dataset includes all the necessary layers to run the application and represents the fundamental drainage area 10AB, located in the Yukon and British Columbia.
  - Upload a custom GeoPackage ('.gpkg'). When using your own dataset, you are responsible for ensuring that all required layers are included and that all layers share a consistent coordinate reference system. Refer to the Datasets tab for a detailed description of required and optional layers.

If a user-defined GeoPackage is uploaded, the app provides an option to classify linear and areal disturbances by industry and type. This classification generates a table used in the next step to assign custom buffer sizes for each industry/type combination.

<hr>
Confirming the source dataset loads the study area along with its underlying layers, allowing you to toggle individual layers on and off in the map legend.


## Buffer features

The **Buffer features** enables users to apply influence buffers around linear and polygonal (areal) disturbances features. 
Users have two options:

  - Apply an overall buffer on the respective layers using sliders, or 
  - Enable custom buffer sizes based on industry and feature types. 
To access the custom buffer table, check the 'Use custom buffers' box â€” this will switch the map view to display the table. Value inside the 'BUFFER_SIZE' column can be edited.

In the left sidebar, minimum patch size of intactness areas can be set using the slider after the buffering on the disturbance features are applied. This function will remove every patch in the study area that are considered not sufficiently large to maintain key ecological processes.

The user can indicate the inclusion of fires and mining claims if present in the gpkg in the generation of footprint and intactness map. Minimum fire size and buffer size around mining claims need to be set prior to generet the maps.

### View map

After a few seconds to a minute, two new layers will appear in the map and legend: a "footprint" layer that shows the human influence on the landscape and an "intactness" layer which shows the distribution of intact areas in the landscape.

### View statistics

The "Statistics" tab on the right panel provides regional estimates of intactness. 
When Intact Forest Landscapes for the years 2000 and 2020 are provided, the user can see comparison of its generated intactness layers to those two. 
The areal extent of burned areas are also shown.

### Download data

Finally, you can click on "Download data" in the left sidebar to save the footprint and intactness layers to a GeoPackage format which can be further viewed and analysed in a GIS e.g., QGIS.
