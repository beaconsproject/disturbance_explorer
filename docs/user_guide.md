# User guide

Understanding human activity is essential for effective conservation planning, land management, and ecological research. Undisturbed areas, often referred to as 
intact landscapes, are critical for maintaining biodiversity, supporting ecosystem services, and preserving ecological integrity. Conversely, identifying disturbed 
areas—such as those affected by roads, industrial activities, or fires—helps quantify human impact and guides conservation efforts.

**Disturbance Explorer** produces undisturbed and disturbed landscape maps for a study area based on human disturbances as well as natural disturbances if desired. 
Users can explore the influence of buffer size and minimum patch size on the resulting undisturbed and disturbed maps. 
This page describes the step-by-step process for creating these maps.

The **Welcome** section includes the **Overview** landing page, providing a concise introduction to the app and its functionality. It also includes this guide and the **Dataset Requirements**, 
which outlines the description, naming convention and data structure of the required spatial layers used by the **Disturbance Explorer** app. 

To get started, click 'Select study area' section on the left-side panel. 


### Select study area

The **Select study area** panel offers two options:

  - **Use demo dataset** embedded in the app. This dataset is for a watershed located in the southeast Yukon and includes all spatial layers required to run the app.
  - **Upload a custom GeoPackage (gpkg)**. Users are responsible for ensuring that all required spatial layers are included and that all 
  layers share a consistent coordinate reference system. Refer to the **Dataset Requirements** tab for a detailed description of required and optional layers, 
  as well as their respective data structure.

If a user-defined GeoPackage is uploaded, the app provides the option to classify linear and areal disturbances by industry and disturbance type. This classification generates 
a table used in the next step to assign custom buffer sizes for each industry/disturbance type combination.

It is also possible for the user to upload additional linear and areal disturbances as shapefiles, which can be included in the mapping workflow or used solely for visualization.

Pressing the **Confirm** button loads the study area along with its underlying layers, allowing the user to toggle individual layers on and off in the map legend.


### Buffer features

The **Buffer features** enables users to apply influence buffers around linear and areal (polygonal) disturbances features. 

Users have two options:

  - Apply an overall buffer on the respective layers using sliders, or 
  - Enable custom buffer sizes based on industry and feature types. 
  
Choosing **Use custom buffers** will switch the map view to display the table where disturbances are summarized by industry/disturbance type. The value inside the 'BUFFER_SIZE' column can be edited.

<br><br>

In the left sidebar, **Set minimum patch size of undisturbed areas** can be set using the slider. 
This function will remove undisturbed patches that are smaller than the set minimum size from the final undisturbed areas map.

The user can choose to include **other disturbances**, **fires**, and **mining claims** in generating the undisturbed and disturbed areas map if the required spatial layers were uploaded in the **Select study area** step. 
If these spatial layers are not provided, the corresponding options will be disabled. 
Default values are provided for buffer sizes as well as the minimum fire size, but these can be adjusted before generating the maps.

<br><br>

#### Generate undisturbed  and disturbed areas

Click on **Generate undisturbed areas** to trigger the generation of undisturbed and disturbed maps. After a few seconds to a minute, two new layers will appear in the 
map and legend: a "disturbed" layer that shows the human/fires influence on the landscape and an "undisturbed" layer which shows all regions within the study region that 
are not intersected by the disturbed areas. These areas are presumed to retain natural ecological conditions.

#### View statistics

The "Statistics" tab on the right panel provides regional summaries of the landscape provided. 
If Intact Forest Landscapes (IFL) for the years 2000 and 2020 are available, users can compare their generated undisturbed areas to these reference datasets.
The table also displays the statistics on fires, mining and protected areas if provided.

### Download data

Finally, users can navigate to the **Download data** panel to initiate the download. This will export the undisturbed and disturbed maps as layers in a GeoPackage format, 
which can be further viewed and analyzed in a GIS application such as QGIS.
